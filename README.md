# KutuphaneTabletApp - 2021 Java Android Project

-This project is an Android tablet application that provides ease in tracking users and books that can be used in libraries.

-There are screens where staff can track books and users, and add users and books to the system. Books are added to the system by staff with information such as category, author, summary, and subject. New users are added to the system by staff, and there is a personalized rating system in the book borrowing and return system.

-Registered users can log into their panels with a username and password, and screens have been created to help them find books based on various filters. Information such as preliminary details about books and location information in the library is provided together. Users can make comments and give ratings about the books they have read. There are also screens for statistics and history related to the books they have read.

-RESTful architecture is used, with a database created in phpMyAdmin. Communication is facilitated through PHP web services running in the repository provided by the hosting company.

-VOLLEY library is used on the application side, and Picasso library is employed for operations related to the images stored on the server.
